# Pset Groups

## Website

This website was built to help Stanford students find pset groups for their classes.

Built with the help of a [Next JS boilerplate](https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate) and [MIT's psetpartners](https://github.com/AndrewVSutherland/psetpartners).

## Matching

The matchings are created using the hill climbing algorithm. The score of a matching is the sum of similarity scores of the vectors representing each partner. Read our full paper here.
